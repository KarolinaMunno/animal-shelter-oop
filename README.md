# Animal Shelter System â€” Java OOP (Iteration & Recursion)

This project demonstrates object-oriented design in Java by modeling an animal shelter system using two approaches:

- `munno_anml_shltr_iteration.java`: Uses iteration (for-each loop) to list animal adoption status.
- `munno_anml_shltr_recursion.java`: Uses recursion to perform the same task.

## Key Concepts
- Abstract classes & inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Recursion vs. Iteration
- Object composition
- Java best practices
